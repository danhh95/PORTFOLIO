    The Handheld Device Markup Language (HDML)</a> is a markup language[2] intended for display on handheld computers, information appliances, smartphones, etc.. It is similar to HTML,[3] but for wireless and handheld devices with small displays, like PDA, mobile phones and so on.
    It was originally developed in about 1996 by Unwired Planet,[1] the company that became Phone.com and then Openwave.[4] HDML was submitted to W3C for standardization,[5] but was not turned into a standard. Instead it became an important influence on the development and standardization of WML, which then replaced HDML in practice. Unlike WML, HDML has no support for scripts.
